# Security 101
Why is Cybersecurity such a desired skill these days?
	- Growing dependence on IT infrastructure.
	- Users are growing exponentially with infinite amounts of devices to target or poke at during all hours.
	- Better tools for bigger damage. Cyber attacks have to inherently get stronger, more sophisticated, aggressive, and disruptive to penetrate network security.
	-Significant Investment by bad actors.
	-70% of cybersecurity professionals say that their org has been impacted by the ongoing global cybersecurity skills shortage.

CyberSecurity
	: Assessing and mitigating risk in order to protect the systems and networks and by extension the users and benefactors of said systems and networks.

CIA Triad
	: Confidentiality, Integrity, Accessibility

Password Saved File analogy
	- The stored passwords are on a file that is accessible to many or very few and only people with authorization.
	- The Passwords are saved in readable text vs. encrypted.
	- The passwords are stored in a server accessible to many people or no people.

DAY 2

What is threat assessment?
	: Threat assessment is the structured process of identifying risks to the security of your network or machine.
Risk mitigation
	: Systematic reduction of the impact and or likely occurence of threats penetrating the network or systems.
