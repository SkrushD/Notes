#### **Policy & Guidelines**
These are Rules set in place by organizations
    **Policy** : A rule that defines the "right" behavior.
        _could be something that informs standards for behavior and operations in practice._
    **Guidelines** : Similar to policies, issued by orgs, are used to make actions of employees and departments more predictable and leads to a higher quality of performed tasks.
#### **Laws, Regulations and Standards**
These are rules set in place by industries, law makers and other governing bodies

    **Regulations** 
    : detailed instructions on how laws should be enforced
    **Standards** 
    : published specifications used to establish a common language and technical criteria across the industry
#### **Business Impact Analysis**
Key points to look at when determining the impact of an attack or shutdown are below
    **Recovery Point Objective**
    : amount of data a company can afford to lose/recover after a disruption or outage.
    **Maximum Tolerable Downtime**
    :  total amount of time a system can be unavailable for users and the business.
            *this is calculated from the two terms below*
        **Recovery Time Objective**
        : maximum tolerable amount of time needed to bring all critical systems back online after a disaster occurs
        **Work Recovery Time**
        : time available to get the systems working again after they come back online.


#### **Governance Framework**
Rules and Policies that must be followed by everyone in an organization or company
        _frameworks are generally used to be in compliance with federal regulations and industry standards_
#### **Risk Managment Framework**
A guide developed by the National Institute of Standards and Technology
        *this framework provides information on what sort of governance networks and systems should have to be in compliance with federal regulations and standards*


###### **Vulnerability**
An aspect of a business that can be exploited to compromise a system's CIA
    CIA : _Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability_
        Saved password file analogy
            The stored passwords are on a file that is accessible to many or very few and only people with authorization.
            The Passwords are saved in readable text vs. encrypted.
            The passwords are stored in a server accessible to many people or no people.
#### **Threat**
An actor that might exploit a vulnerability
