1969-1970 Dennis Ritchie and Kenneth Thompson at AT&T Bell Labs began developing a small operating system called Unix

IN 91 Linus Torvalds used many of the components from the GNU project to create linux as a free open source operating system (FOSS).

Command-line only machines are called headless servers.

/var/log is where log files are stored which will contain logs for the system and other processes like apache web servers and others.

Memory
	: the space used by a process to save and manipulate data.
		RAM - random access memory is used to run the program'sÂ  code. The more work a process does the more it needs.

Dynamic analysis
	: the process of runnnig a potientially malicious script and moitoring its effects.
		_alternatively, static analysis is combing through the code_

	_ps auxf shows trees of multiple apps that are run by each other instead of as individual process ids_

##### Day 2 Access Controls

Hashes are one way encryption of passwords.
	the same password = always the same hash
		_cracking is cross referencing lists of hashes with the hash you have and finding the password correlated with that hash._
`sudo john shadow_copy --show
	_shows cracked passwords from the file shadow_copy_
sudo (super user do) gives users the power to run commands as the root user
	 sudo can be configured per user
		_also can be configured which programs that user can use sudo_
	-l argument lists permissions
	-lU argument listss permissions for specific users 
	`sudo usermod -aG sudo sally
		_adds sally to the sudo group giving sudo permissions._
	sudo visudo will open /etc/sudoers.tmp
		#includedir is tthe heading in this sudoers file where you can add sudo command privileges for specific commands 
			**like less which can be exploited**
	looking for processes that are being run by users will show as root if you run sudo
su (switch user) switches users fi permitted

gtfobins.com

`id` to identify users and groups on the system
	- user id below 1000 is system user
	- above 1000 is standard user
	- 0 is reserved only for root

_these commands were used in the demo to modify groups and users._

##### Day 3 Permissions and Services

Each item has an Owner, Group, and other users
	- items have priveleges Read Write and Execute
	- these permissions can be applied to the three parties differently
	- DAC
		: Discretionary Access Controls
Reading and Manipulating permissions
```bash
ls -l # returns drwx-wx--x format with files
		# - DIR/FILE --- Owner --- Group --- Other Users perm
chmod # changes permissions
# permissions can be set with u=rwx g=rwx or o=rwx // or with numeric values 4=read 2=write 1=execute (add these for multiple permissions like 7=rwx)
chown #changes the owner and group of a file.	
```
Identifying services and stopping them
```bash
systemctl -t service -all #stops service
systemctl status *service* # tells status and info for service
systemctl stop *service* # stops service
systemctl enable/disable # starts on boot on/off
sudo apt remove *package* # removes the app/service
```
Service users or UID 1-999
```bash
deluser # deletes users (also arg for deleting the users files by using --remove-all-files)
adduser # adds users (using --system creates system users/service users and usually want to be created with the --no-create-home argument as well.)
```
